            <h2>by <a href="https://americanliterature.com/author/hans-christian-andersen"> Hans Christian Andersen</h2></a>
            <br>
            <p>Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, "he is sitting in council," it was always said of him, "The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe."

                Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.
                
                "These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!" thought the Emperor. "Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately." And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly.
                
                So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night.
                
                "I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth," said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be sure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.
                
                "I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers," said the Emperor at last, after some deliberation, "he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is."So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might, at their empty looms. "What can be the meaning of this?" thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. "I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms." However, he did not express his thoughts aloud.

                The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was nothing there. "What!" thought he again. "Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff."</p><br>

            <h1>THE EAGLE AND THE FOX </h1>
            <br>
            <p>This is an amazing animals story in english. Once upon a time, an eagle befriended a fox. Soon both of them became extremely close. They became so close that they decided to build homes next to each other. As a result, the eagle built its nest near the bushes where the fox lived. They were happy together.

                Time flew by and both the friends had children of their own. They loved their children. One day, the fox left its cubs in the bushes. “I’ll be back soon,” she promised her children, “I have to look for some food.” After saying so, she dashes away in search of prey. While mother fox was away, the eagle’s babies got hungry. “But I do not have any food to feed them,” the eagle thought sadly.

                Then, the evil eagle spots one of the fox cubs playing around. The eaglets were crying out of hunger. “I should feed one of the cubs to my children,” the eagle decided and swooped down to pick one up. The eagle fed her friend’s one of the cubs. When the mother fox returned, she saw the eagle feeding her child to her babies. “What have you done?” she asks the eagle, crying all the while. The poor mother fox was heartbroken and in pain. “You have cheated a friend, a good friend,” she cried as she took her cubs and left never to see the eagle again.
                
                
                Even after being cheated on by a friend, the fox never for wished any harm to her friend. She was a good friend. But God had other plans. Also, read The Eagle And The Arrow.<br>One day, when the eaglets were hungry, the mother eagle set out to hunt again. This time she went to the nearby village. “I will surely find easy prey here,” she thought. Soon, she found a big chunk of a dead goat. Which she picked up hurriedly and flew back. But as soon as she put it in her nest to feed the eaglets, the nest caught fire. The poor eaglets were hurt badly. And one of the eaglets died too.


                The poor eagle was heartbroken and in pain. The fox happened to be passing by that day. She saw the eagle’s nest on fire. “God has punished you for betraying a dear friend,” she said and went away with a heavy heart. She had not wanted her friend to suffer the same pain of losing a child. But this was divine justice, God had punished the one who deserved to be punished nevertheless.
